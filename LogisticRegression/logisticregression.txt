Logistic Regression -

    Mainly used for Binary Classification Problems

    Linear Regression problems are customed to outliers and make a model that even is not accurate with training data
    and value range from -inf to +inf but classification problem require 0 or 1.

    It uses formula (1/1+e^-z) which makes sure it lies in range 0 to 1 and if >0.5 then 1 else 0

    here z iz y = mx+c problem only. The either side of line are 0 and 1.

Metrics - 
    
    Confusion matrix - gives us all the TP,TN,FP,FN
    
    accuracy - TP+TN/FP+FN+TP+TN

    precision - TP/TP+FP

    recall - TP/TP+FN

One Versus Rest - 

    When Using Logistic Regression in Multi Class Classification problem

    One Versus Rest there takes the output as one and remaining all as other output

    EX: O1,O2,O3 are there in which the model takes first O1 as one output and O2,O3 as other output combined
    and then predict the chance of O1. then do the same with reming two and which value is higher gets chosen.

Parameters - 

    C-Score

    class_weight - for imbalanced datasetS

    penalty - for ridge,lasso,elastic net . default = ridge

    solver - optimization

CrossValidation -

    GridSearchCV

    RandomizedsearchCV - when GridSearchCV takes a lot of time.
