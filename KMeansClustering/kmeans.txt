K Means Clustering-

    In K Means we find intialize as K as no.of groups we want in our dataset.

    Then we randomly assign 2 centroid in the dataset

    We create a line at the centroid and 1 Perpendicular line to this line

    The 2 Sides of Lines are 2 Different groups

    Then mark the ponts of either side as respective group

    Then move the centroid by averaging all the points

    Then do the process again of making a line,Perpendicualr line and segmenting until there is a lines
    that do not have any errors in grouping .

    Note: If a group1 point of previous iteration is now in group2 side.group1 point becomes group2

    How to Find the K Value-

        We Keep a graph of (sum of total distance of all points to nearest centroid) in various k values
        
        ranging 1 to n . we take a k value where we see the k value graph is stagnating.
