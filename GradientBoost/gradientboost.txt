        First we take average of output variable and take residual from every data point using avg as y_pred

        using avg as output we will train a model and get a *y_pred(1)

        add that y_pred to avg and it will give some value

        One Weak model is now ready

        Now continue the process keeping avg same.

        here formula is y_pred = y_actual - (alpha)*(*y_pred(1))
