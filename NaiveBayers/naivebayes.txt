Naive Bayes-

    This is used for both binary or multi-class Classification

    They use the equation 

            P(o1/(if1,if2)) = P(o1) * P(o1/f1) * P(o1/f2)
            P(o2/(if1,if2)) = P(o2) * P(o2/f1) * P(o2/f2)

            and P(o1 for if1 and if2) = P(o1/(if1,if2)) / P(o2/(if1,if2))
            and P(o2 for if1 and if2) = P(o2/(if1,if2)) / P(o1/(if1,if2))
        
    BY above procedures you get your probabilities

Naive bayes Variants-

        Gaussian Naive Bayes-

                It is used when a normal distribution is observed in independent features
        
        Bernoulli Distribution -

                It is used when the independent features are either binary
        
        Multinomial Distribution - 

                It is used when the independent features are "text"
