Baggind and Boosting ensemble techniques:

    Ensemble Techniques : Multiple ML models are combined to one model.

    Bagging : In this different ML models(Linear,SVM,KNN,DecisionTree,Naive) are given its own value
              and majority is taken for Classification and Average for Regression
    
    Boosting : In this different weak ML models are joined together to give an Strong ML model.

Random Forest:

    In Random Forest we use Bagging Ensemble technique with only DecisionTree models.

    By using Random Forest we Reduce the Overfitting problem in DT
